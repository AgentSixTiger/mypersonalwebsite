        <h1>Young Sherlock: The Farmyard Mystery</h1>
           <h2> A story by Bennett Hobbs</h2>
<h3>The Sherlock Family Farm</h3>
<p>I was sitting in the kitchen. My father, however, was out in the fields taking care of the crops. He was busy taking care of the plants so often that I was usually sitting on my own, reading mystery novels, or with my mother.

One day my father was out in the corn fields. I had taken a liking to watch his work for the past few days. I noticed he had dropped his gloves and I saw him disappear beneath the rows of corn. I awaited his return, however he never seemed to reappear. 

At the time I thought nothing of it. But later that evening when father usually comes in for supper, i expected his arrival, but he never came. The fact that father did not come for his food worried me, I then took it into my own hands to go fetch him. Flashlight in hand, I left the house and delved into the blood-red glow of the setting sun.

As I reached the spot where my father had disappeared, I began to notice deep grooves in the ground, like something had been dragged. I followed them, and they brought me to a run-down house I never knew existed. The lights were on, and when I peeked in the window, I saw my father! He was tied to a chair, and a strange man was standing over him. I began to think of a plan to rescue my father. After all those mystery novels I read waiting for my father to come home from the fields, I hoped I could find a good idea. Then, the strange man turned around, and saw me.

He bellowed with rage, and charged out the front door towards me. He lunged at me, but I dove out of the way, and the man hit the wall, crumpling into a heap. I went inside the house and untied my father. He said,  "Thank you for the rescue. But, Sherlock, you do realise your mother will kill us for being late for dinner, right?" I smiled, and replied, "You are probably right. Let's get home then!" And with that, we set off home. I had this itching feeling that this wouldn't be the last mystery I would solve. If only I knew how right I was…

<h3>Dolphins dying due to a lunatic</h3>
<p>
    Unfortunately, dolphins in zoos have started to die because of their food. According to the F.F.A.A (Federation for Animals Association), dolphins have started to die due to their fish.The fish are being fed too much protein, causing their bones to be too strong, cutting up the dolphin's bellies. When asked about this, the zoos claim that they know nothing about it, but a new type of fish farm has been rumoured to be dosing up their fish to attempt to kill off dolphins. Is this an accident, or the start of a sinister plot?

    Upon further questioning, the CEO of the fish farm shouted "The dolphins deserve it! I hope they all go extinct!" before jumping out of the window into a waiting helicopter. Zoos are being advised to test each batch of their fish before feeding to their dolphins. Hopefully this situation can be solved before any more innocent dolphins are hurt. Please remember that the dolphin murderer is still at large. If you see a man matching this description, please report him to the local authorities.

<h3> </h3>
<p> It all started with Barney. Most people know about Barney, the famous purple dinosaur, but nobody knows about his dark past. Well, almost nobody. I do. He wants to kill me for it. You see, before he became a beloved TV star, he ruled the streets. He was the biggest crime lord the world had ever known. No one could find any evidence against him. Until I did. He was in a partnership with a certain drug cartel, and I found his name in their ledgers. Now he wants me dead. I'm living in hiding. It is only a matter of time before he finds me. And when he does... I'd prefer not to think about that. I've installed booby traps all throughout the building I'm hiding in. In fact, one just got triggered. Oh god. It's Barney's gang, the Purple Predators. I gotta run. I hear them in the stairwell. Luckily, I have a backdoor. I just gotta-He's here. He's standing in the doorway. I can't let him catch me! I gotta run. AAAAAAAAGH! He shot me in the leg! My leg is gone! No. He's coming closer! This is going to be the end...</p>
