            <h2>The Lucky Cat (Maneki-neko)</h2>

           <p> In many Asian stores around the world,  it is common to see a cat figurine gesturing with its paw. First seen in Japan in the 17th century, this cat came to be known as a lucky cat.  The cat has many different colours, all made to bring different types of fortune to the owner.  The lucky cat also has many different origin stories, with two being the most famous.
       
            The first popular story came from ancient Japan, when the Daimyo (a Japanese feudal lord) was out with his samurai practicing falconry. Nearby, there was an ancient, run-down temple where there lived an old monk.  As the temple was crumbling, the monk worried about how he would keep it running. Every day, he would meditate, looking for an answer.  One day as he was meditating, a stray cat wandered past the door. The monk invited the poor creature inside and gave it food. The cat then stayed with the monk. Meanwhile, the Daimyo had gotten separated from his hunting group and came across the temple. He saw the cat outside, waving its paw, beckoning him in. Just as the Daimyo started to move, lightning struck where he had been standing. The cat had saved his life! He walked inside the temple and found the head monk. He told the monk what had happened and asked how he could repay him. The monk responded that his temple was in decay and he wanted to fix it. The Daimyo brought the temple under his family’s name and it was restored to its former glory. Since then, hundreds of lucky cats have been left at this temple with a wish from the person who left them hoping that good luck will come their way.
       
       The second story has its roots in a widow’s home, where her recently deceased cat’s spirit had visited her in a dream.  He told her to make figurines of himself and sell them in the market. If she did what he asked, great prosperity was promised to her. The old woman obliged, making figurines of her cat with one paw raised. They turned out to be very popular, and the woman grew rich with each passing day.  This story has more credibility than the first, since an artist’s wood print of that time had been found, which depicts a crowded Japanese market. The upper left corner of the print shows a stall, selling none other than lucky cats! It was the earliest ever evidence that lucky cats existed.
       
       The lucky cat is now a widely known figurine and is seen all over the world.  Although the origins are unclear, the purpose of the cat is clear: to bless the owner with a life filled with good fortune.

            <h2>Onsen</h2>

       <p> Onsen are Japanese hot spring baths that go back in history over 3000 years. The water is piped directly from geothermal springs. An onsen is a place of cleanliness, so you have to shower before getting into any bath. Due to the yakuza, tattoos are not permitted in an onsen. A tattoo must be covered or you will not be permitted entry in most onsen. An onsen is completely naked, so most public onsen will be separated into different genders. Onsen are marked on a map or sign with the symbol ♨. They are traditionally built outdoors but nowadays they are very popular indoors in hotels and inns. Not many traditional onsen remain, and many towns are a tourist destination just for their onsen. Swimsuits are by default not allowed, unless the onsen in question is a mixed bath. Some onsen allow a small towel to be brought in, but all other accessories including clothing must remain in a locker outside the bathing area. Since traditional onsen use unchlorinated water, bathers are recommended to not use the onsen if the customer has an open wound, to prevent infection. In short, onsen are traditional baths nowadays ranging from traditional to modern.

    <h2>Sumo Wrestling</h2>

   <p> Sumo wrestling is a Japanese sport that has been taught and practiced through the generations. The object of the sport is to push and maneuver one’s opponent out of the ring.  The sport of sumo is connected to many unique traditions, such as the clay platform upon which the sumo wrestlers fight. The clay surface is hand-packed by a team of people to the point where it is as hard as concrete. Everything about sumo is special and handmade, from the haircuts to the robes they wear in the opening ceremony. Sumo wrestlers have been pictured as having lots of body fat, but only some are as big as the stereotypical image most people have. Sumo is a hard sport to be good at and wrestlers dedicate most of their lives to it.  In Japan, sumos are like legends and are highly respected.  People pay hundreds of dollars for a ticket to see them fight.

     <h1>Japanese Martial Arts</h1>
    <h2>Judo</h2>

   <p> Judo is a form of martial arts roughly meaning unarmed combat. It is different to other martial arts because it uses free sparring, instead of pre-arranged fights and uses no weapons or poles of any sort. Judo tournaments have been hosted by the Tokyo metropolitan police department and judo is now the main martial art used by the Tokyo police. Founded in 1882, the creator of judo bought a dojo near a buddhist temple, and from there he taught as a sensei. Judo is now widely known, and it is very interesting how judo uses balance and momentum to take your opponent off their feet.

    <h2>Ninjutsu</h2>

   <p> Ninjutsu is a martial art that focuses less on hand-to-hand combat, and more on concealment and guerilla tactics. Ninjutsu was commonly used by the shinobi, which started as scouts or spies for hire. Shinobi (Samurai that specialized in scouting and spying) would usually use deception and stealth instead of direct confrontation.  Shinobi never actually assassinated that many people, since they were spies more than assassins. Given the opportunity to kill a powerful enemy, they would take it. Ninjutsu trained archery, medicine, concealment, escape and disguise.

     <h2>Kendo</h2>

   <p> Kendo is a Japanese martial art that focuses on weaponry. The Japanese word ‘Kendo’ literally means ‘The way of the sword’. It is a descendant of Samurai dueling, but it is practiced with padded armor and bamboo poles. People who know kendo are called kendoku. Kendo is a very noisy sport, since at every strike the kendoku will stomp on the floor and shout to show the fighting spirit they possess. Kendo armor is made up of padded clothing, with a mask much like those used in fencing. Kendo is a great martial art, since it practices the art of samurai dueling, albeit safer.

    <h1>Japanese Foods</h1>
    <h2>Dumplings</h2>

   <p> Dumplings are a popular Japanese food filled with vegetables or pork and are eaten all over the world with different variations based on the country. Dumplings are not gyoza, since gyoza have a thinner dough wrap and more finely chopped stuffing. Dumplings are often steamed, while gyoza can be both steamed and cooked. Dumplings are also usually fluffier and bigger than gyoza. Dumplings are a delicious meal and are great to have for a tasty treat.

     <h2>Takoyaki</h2>

   <p> Takoyaki was first made by a street vendor in Osaka in 1935.  It is a Japanese food that is made up of octopus pieces fried into dough to make a sort of octopus batter ball. It is very often seen being prepared and sold by street vendors in Japan. The pan in which to prepare takoyaki is molded in a shape that makes cooking this dish considerably easier, since the dough is already being molded while it's cooking.  Takoyaki can also be found in restaurants, and are eaten with a sauce similar to Worcestershire sauce. This tasty treat is quite good to have as a quick snack to satisfy your taste buds.

    <h2>Sushi vs. Sashimi
    </h2>

   <p> A common mistake is to think sushi is raw fish. Sashimi is raw fish by itself, usually on a platter with more sashimi. Sushi is raw fish on top of or wrapped in rice. It is easy to make a mistake, and no one will get mad at you, but it is just good to know the difference. Sushi can sometimes be served without seaweed and with fish eggs or spicy mayo (though not traditionally with the mayo), while sashimi is only slabs of fish, almost always accompanied with some type of sauce. Although it isn’t recommended to walk into someone’s house and compliment them on their sushi, even though it’s sashimi, nobody will not invite you back to their house, and it’s just a little mistake to make.

     <h2>Tempura</h2>

   <p> Tempura is a Japanese food made by deep frying assorted vegetables and seafood in batter. Tempura was introduced to the Japanese by the Portuguese in the 16th century.  Its name comes from the latin word Tenpura meaning the fasting that took place during the time when the Catholic church proclaimed that Catholics should not eat meat. The batter is made up of iced water, flour and eggs. Tempura is now a common side dish to be ordered in Japanese restaurants all over the world.

     <h1>Biographies</h1>
    <h2>Louis Hebert</h2>

   <p> Louis Hebert was born in Paris in 1575. His father was an apothecary, and, following the tradition of the time, was trained in medical arts and science to become one. He became a specialist in pharmacology, developing a lifelong interest in plants and gardening. In 1600, he was established as an apothecary and spice merchant. 

    In 1604, Louis Hebert’s cousin led an expedition to New France, losing 36 out of 80 men due to a lack of fresh water and firewood. In 1606, Louis joined the expedition and helped construct a grist-mill near the Allain river. In 1610, he moved to Port Royal. Champlain, who had founded Quebec in 1608, realized that Quebec needed medical service, and, having met Louis Hebert on an earlier expedition to Port Royal, gave Louis a job offer in Quebec.
    
    Louis accepted, with his contract being that he would live, practice medicine and establish farms in Quebec with his family for 3 years, in return for a salary of 600 livres (pounds) annually. Louis sold his practice and house, and he and his family moved to Honfleur. He was then told that the offer could only go forward if Louis signed a new contract that reduced his salary to 300 livres yearly. Having already sold his practice and house, he reluctantly agreed.
    
    Hebert arrived in Quebec in 1617, becoming the first private individual to receive a grant of land from the New France government, and in 1620 he was made procurator to the king, which meant he could intervene in matters in the name of the king. He later became the first Seigneur of New France, and is considered the first European apothecary in the region now known as Canada. He died on January 25, 1627, from injuries after slipping on ice. The entire colony held a funeral for him, and he was buried first in Recollets cemetery, and then in the vault of the Recollets, being the first laid to rest in the new structure.

         <h2>Jeanne Mance</h2>

   <p> Jeanne Mance was the daughter of an attorney that is thought to have learned medical skills during the Thirty Years War (1618 to 1648). Jeanne, being an amazing speaker, ran fundraisers and found donors for the establishment of Montreal. She and 37 other people moved to Montreal island in 1642, and began living in the woods. 55 total people stayed on the island over winter. The next year, Jeanne set up a hospital within a fort’s palisades, which soon attracted the attention of the Wendat (Huron) indigenous peoples, who were French allies. The indigenous people became patients and christian converts, and French travelers and explorers were also treated after being wounded by Haudenosaunee people who did not want French traders on their lands. Jeanne Mance was later named a co-founder of  Montreal. She was the colony’s treasurer, director of supplies and hospital director, and in 1649 she sailed back across the Atlantic to renew interest in the colony. She began trying to recruit more men to defend the colony, but before she could spark enough interest, the Montreal colony was caught in the middle of the Franco-Iroquois war. By 1651, there were only 17 militiamen to defend against the 200 Haudenosaunee. She finally convinced Governor Maisonneuve to send reinforcements, and relief arrived in 1653.  It was later argued that Mance’s actions to raise troops saved the settlement. In 1659, the Sisters of Saint Joseph were recruited to work in the hospital, and from that point onwards, the hospital grew to a much-beloved three-storey institution. Today, a statue of Jeanne stands guard outside the hospital.

         <h2>Adam Dollard
    </h2>

   <p> Almost nothing is known about Adam Dollard’s early life, but he probably had military training and a leadership role in the French army before moving to North America. At the age of 22, he arrived at Ville-Marie in 1658. He was the commander of the Ville-Marie garrison, sharing his position with Pierre Picoté de Belestre. He learned that a large group of Haudenosaunee warriors were nearby, so he led a party of 44 experienced indigenous warriors and 16 less experienced French warriors to fight them off. After 10 days of canoeing, they found a spot to ambush the Haudenosaunee, but were spotted and took refuge in an abandoned Algonquin fort. The Haudenosaunee tried to negotiate with the French and indigenous warriors, but the less experienced French thought this was a trick. The fort was little more than a palisade, and the French and their allies were trapped in the fort, as the Haundenosaunee had laid siege to them. After 10 days of fighting, the Haudenosaunee army of 200 grew to 700 indigenous people. The French indigenous allies struck a treaty with the Haudenosaunee, and began to desert. The French opened fire and broke the treaty, so the Haudenosaunee charged the fort again. Adam attempted to fight off the Haudenosaunee by throwing a gunpowder keg at them, but it bounced off a tree limb and fell back into the fort, killing or wounding all remaining defenders. None of the French soldiers made it out alive. Adam Dollard is considered a hero and a martyr for diverting the attack on Ville-Marie, but historians debate whether or not the Haudenosaunee were going to attack the town, as there was no proof that that was their goal. Whatever may have happened, Adam Dollard is still credited as a hero and had many places named after him in Quebec.

             <h2>Jean Talon</h2>

   <p> Jean Talon was the first high ranking administrative official (Intendant) of New France. His objective was to convert a small fur trade outpost under company rule into an independent royal province capable of self-defense. To do this, he evaluated timber and mineral resources, encouraged commercial farming and shipbuilding, and established a brewery and fostered trade with the West Indies. Jean Talon also penalized bachelors and rewarded marriage and large families to attempt to grow the population of around 2000 immigrants, retired soldiers and indigenous people. His ideas conflicted with Jean Colbert’s ideas of a small, defensible colony, so Jean Talon conceded and founded three villages. In 1671, he asked the king for permission to return to France, and in 1672 he traveled back to Europe. He was then appointed secretary to the king, and named Count d’Orsainville. In New France, without him, his colony failed and, for 3 years, the government stopped investing large amounts of money into colonies. Jean Talon is remembered as an industrial entrepreneur, and died on the 24 of November, 1694.

             <h2>James Wolfe</h2>

   <p> James Wolfe was born to a family with a long history of military service, so the family moved to northwest Kent in 1738 to send James and his brother to military school. When Britain declared war on Spain, James’s father was promoted to colonel of a new regiment of marines, and 13 year old James joined as a volunteer. Right before he was supposed to leave, he fell ill and stayed in Britain. During the war of Austrian succession, he and his brother were transferred to the 12th Regiment of Foot. They fought at the battle of Dettingen, and after the battle, James was promoted to lieutenant. In June 1744, he was promoted to captain and transferred to the 4th foot. His brother then died in October of 1744. In 1745, he was recalled to Britain to put down the Jacobite rebellion. James fought in the battle of Culloden in 1746, and the Jacobites were slaughtered and hunted down. In 1759, James Wolfe was appointed Major General and commander of British land forces against Quebec. After failing to take the city several times, James decided to sail 3 km upstream of Quebec and attack from there. Montcalm, the French commander, decided to attack quickly, and fought the entire British force. James Wolfe was shot 3 times in the first few minutes of the battle, staying alive until he heard the French were retreating, then died. Montcalm was also wounded during the battle, and died the next morning. When news of James's death reached Britain, he was considered a war hero and martyr, and was celebrated by people of Canada and Britain for 150 years.
