            <h2>The Lucky Cat (Maneki-neko)</h2>

           <p> In many Asian stores around the world,  it is common to see a cat figurine gesturing with its paw. First seen in Japan in the 17th century, this cat came to be known as a lucky cat.  The cat has many different colours, all made to bring different types of fortune to the owner.  The lucky cat also has many different origin stories, with two being the most famous.
       
            The first popular story came from ancient Japan, when the Daimyo (a Japanese feudal lord) was out with his samurai practicing falconry. Nearby, there was an ancient, run-down temple where there lived an old monk.  As the temple was crumbling, the monk worried about how he would keep it running. Every day, he would meditate, looking for an answer.  One day as he was meditating, a stray cat wandered past the door. The monk invited the poor creature inside and gave it food. The cat then stayed with the monk. Meanwhile, the Daimyo had gotten separated from his hunting group and came across the temple. He saw the cat outside, waving its paw, beckoning him in. Just as the Daimyo started to move, lightning struck where he had been standing. The cat had saved his life! He walked inside the temple and found the head monk. He told the monk what had happened and asked how he could repay him. The monk responded that his temple was in decay and he wanted to fix it. The Daimyo brought the temple under his family’s name and it was restored to its former glory. Since then, hundreds of lucky cats have been left at this temple with a wish from the person who left them hoping that good luck will come their way.
       
       The second story has its roots in a widow’s home, where her recently deceased cat’s spirit had visited her in a dream.  He told her to make figurines of himself and sell them in the market. If she did what he asked, great prosperity was promised to her. The old woman obliged, making figurines of her cat with one paw raised. They turned out to be very popular, and the woman grew rich with each passing day.  This story has more credibility than the first, since an artist’s wood print of that time had been found, which depicts a crowded Japanese market. The upper left corner of the print shows a stall, selling none other than lucky cats! It was the earliest ever evidence that lucky cats existed.
       
       The lucky cat is now a widely known figurine and is seen all over the world.  Although the origins are unclear, the purpose of the cat is clear: to bless the owner with a life filled with good fortune.

        <h2>Onsen</h2>

       <p> Onsen are Japanese hot spring baths that go back in history over 3000 years. The water is piped directly from geothermal springs. An onsen is a place of cleanliness, so you have to shower before getting into any bath. Due to the yakuza, tattoos are not permitted in an onsen. A tattoo must be covered or you will not be permitted entry in most onsen. An onsen is completely naked, so most public onsen will be separated into different genders. Onsen are marked on a map or sign with the symbol ♨. They are traditionally built outdoors but nowadays they are very popular indoors in hotels and inns. Not many traditional onsen remain, and many towns are a tourist destination just for their onsen. Swimsuits are by default not allowed, unless the onsen in question is a mixed bath. Some onsen allow a small towel to be brought in, but all other accessories including clothing must remain in a locker outside the bathing area. Since traditional onsen use unchlorinated water, bathers are recommended to not use the onsen if the customer has an open wound, to prevent infection. In short, onsen are traditional baths nowadays ranging from traditional to modern.

    <h2>Sumo Wrestling</h2>

   <p> Sumo wrestling is a Japanese sport that has been taught and practiced through the generations. The object of the sport is to push and maneuver one’s opponent out of the ring.  The sport of sumo is connected to many unique traditions, such as the clay platform upon which the sumo wrestlers fight. The clay surface is hand-packed by a team of people to the point where it is as hard as concrete. Everything about sumo is special and handmade, from the haircuts to the robes they wear in the opening ceremony. Sumo wrestlers have been pictured as having lots of body fat, but only some are as big as the stereotypical image most people have. Sumo is a hard sport to be good at and wrestlers dedicate most of their lives to it.  In Japan, sumos are like legends and are highly respected.  People pay hundreds of dollars for a ticket to see them fight.
